            <p>My name is Cara Rosa. I am a sophomore in college. Currently, I am enrolled in the University of Austin Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. In high school, I took three computer classes: Computer Skills, Graphic & Web Design, and Computer Science. I was introduced to HTML, CSS, Python, and JavaScript. Using these languages, I was able to build simple webpages and an alien invasion game. I truly enjoyed making these websites by myself or in group projects. Group projects were great resources that taught me a great deal about the importance of collaboration with others. Organization and clear communication about the project were tools that I was able to observe and learn. It was key to have a consolidated plan that would guide the group succinctly. Assigned roles and expectations needed to be communicated in order for the group project to reach a successful closure. Being part of a group project or even leading one has allowed me to observe and understand the importance of working together in this industry. I look forward to honing my skills further and developing a deeper understanding of the coding world.</p>
